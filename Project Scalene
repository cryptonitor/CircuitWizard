This is Project Scalene.

//Meaning of life in the form of mathematical revolt against the essence of physics, and the ghosts of infinity agast at the Scalene Triangle closeness to creation itself//
 
ECCentric Computation Collider: 
FPGA-Analog HybridIzatruion for Elliptic-Curve  Cryptographic Key Search.

Scalene isnt just about ECC key-search. S
Scalene becomes a vehicle for exploring the edges of mathematics, physics, and reality itself.
