    Contextual Inference:
        Infer the identity of components with missing or unclear markings based on their connections and surrounding components.
        Use probabilistic models and existing component databases for inference.

    Database Integration:
        Cross-reference identified components with an extensive parts database.
        Provide detailed information about each component, including datasheets, specifications, and alternatives.

    Schematic Generation:
        Generate a rough schematic diagram of the circuit based on the identified components and their connections.

Secondary Features:

    User Feedback Loop:
        Allow users to confirm or correct component identification to improve the model over time.
        Collect feedback to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the utility.

    Platform Compatibility:
        Develop a mobile app compatible with both Android and iOS.
        Ensure a user-friendly interface for capturing images and viewing results.

    Offline Functionality:
        Enable offline functionality for component recognition and inference, with periodic synchronization to update the database.
