Whitepaper: Circuit Board Mapping Program

Introduction
The Circuit Board Mapping Program aims to streamline the reverse engineering of circuit boards by leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. This innovative tool will capture high-resolution images of circuit boards using a phone camera, identify and label components, and generate schematic diagrams, significantly reducing the time and effort required for such tasks. The project is developed in collaboration with AI (ChatGPT-4), focusing on enhancing learning, automating repetitive tasks, and exploring AI's role in engineering.
Goals
1. Learn: Enhance knowledge and skills in AI, image processing, and circuit board reverse engineering.
2. Skip the Boring Parts: Automate tedious tasks to focus on more complex and rewarding aspects of engineering.
3. Collaborate with AI: Investigate and experience the potential of AI as a collaborative tool in engineering projects.
Scope
Primary Features:
1. Image Capture and Processing:
Capture high-resolution images of circuit boards using a phone camera.
Enhance images to improve clarity and visibility of components and traces.
2. Component Recognition:
Identify and label visible components on the circuit board using image processing and machine learning.
Recognize common components (resistors, capacitors, ICs, etc.) based on their shape, size, and markings.
3. Contextual Inference:
Infer the identity of components with missing or unclear markings based on their connections and surrounding components.
Use probabilistic models and existing component databases for inference.
4. Database Integration:
Cross-reference identified components with an extensive parts database.
Provide detailed information about each component, including datasheets, specifications, and alternatives.
5. Schematic Generation:
Generate a rough schematic diagram of the circuit based on the identified components and their connections.
Secondary Features:
1. User Feedback Loop:
Allow users to confirm or correct component identification to improve the model over time.
Collect feedback to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the utility.
2. Platform Compatibility:
Develop a mobile app compatible with both Android and iOS.
Ensure a user-friendly interface for capturing images and viewing results.
3. Offline Functionality:
Enable offline functionality for component recognition and inference, with periodic synchronization to update the database.
Stakeholders
Primary Stakeholders:
1. Electronics Engineers and Technicians: Primary users who will benefit from the utility for reverse engineering and repair tasks.
